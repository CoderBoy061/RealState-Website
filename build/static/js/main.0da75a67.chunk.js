In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a person\'s estate; or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things,[1][2][3] as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it. In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property).[4] Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party\'s will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional,[citation needed] so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute. The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.[5] In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.[6][7]'})]})})};n(33);var u=function(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{className:"about",children:Object(d.jsx)("div",{class:"topnav1",children:Object(d.jsx)("p",{align:"center",children:"BIGG BIZZ 2021-2022 || ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"})})})};var f=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(d.jsx)(p,{}),Object(d.jsxs)(a.d,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(a.b,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:h}),Object(d.jsx)(a.b,{exact:!0,path:"/contact",component:j}),Object(d.jsx)(a.b,{exact:!0,path:"/about",component:m}),Object(d.jsx)(a.a,{to:"/"})]}),Object(d.jsx)(u,{})]})};r.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)(b.a,{children:Object(d.jsx)(f,{})})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[34,1,2]]]);
